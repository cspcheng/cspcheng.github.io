## Topics

I am interested in Spatial Databases, with a particular focus on Spatial Crowdsourcing, Ridesharing, Spatial Advertising. Recently, I also work on Graph Databases, Blockchain and Knowledge Graph.

## Code


I try to publish code promptly. You are welcome to contribute to the projects and cooperate with me and my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/stc">team</a>.     

- [Latex Template](https://github.com/haidaoxiaofei/cs-latex-template) for CS papers: a simple latex template of cs papers for junior PG students. Many other useful materials are also put in the repository.
- [gMission](http://gmission.github.io): a general spatial crowdsourcing platform.
- [Spatial Crowdsourcing Dataset Generator](https://github.com/gmission/SCDataGenerator): a toolbox to generate the synthetic datasets for spatial crowdsourcing applications.
- [Benchmark for Task Assignment in Spatial Crowdsourcing](https://github.com/gmission/SpatialCrowdsourcingAssignmentAlgorithms): a benchmark to test the representitive algorithms for task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing. Details in our VLDB 2018 experiment analyses paper: An Experimental Evaluation of Task Assignment in Spatial Crowdsourcing.
- [Queueing-Theoretic Framework for online Car-hailing](https://github.com/haidaoxiaofei/queueing-car-hailing): a framework to maximize the served requests of online car-hailing platforms using a queueing theoretic framework with DNN spatiotemporal prediction models. Details in our ICDE 2019 short paper: A Queueing-Theoretic Framework for Vehicle Dispatching in Dynamic Car-Hailing. An updated and enhanced framework for our VLDB 2021 full paper can be found [here](https://github.com/inabao/queue-based-order-dispatching)!
- [Demand-Aware Route Planning for Shared Mobility Services](https://github.com/dominatorX/DAIF): a framework to maximize the overall uitility of online ridesharing platforms using a demand-aware insertion route planning basic operator. Details in our VLDB 2020 paper: Demand-Aware Route Planning for Shared Mobility Services. 
- [GridTuner](https://github.com/inabao/region_division_code): a out-of-box tool to tune the size of grids for spatiotemporal prediction models to maximize the utility of the applications. Details in our ICDE 2022 paper: GridTuner: Reinvestigate Grid Size Selection for Spatiotemporal Prediction Models.
- [Efficient K-clique Listing](https://github.com/zer0y/k-clique-listing): source code of our ICDE 2022 paper: Efficient k-clique Listing with Set Intersection Speedup.
