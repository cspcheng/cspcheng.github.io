Spatial crowdsourcing is an extension of general crowdsourcing. Specifically, in spatial crowdsourcing, crowd or workers need to physically move to a particular place associated with a spatial task. In different branch areas of computer science, this new topic has different names, such as spatial crowdsourcing, mobile crowdsourcing and participatory sensing. Here is a reading list about this topic. I will update it aperiodically.
