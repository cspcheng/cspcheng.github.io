"The arXiv is a repository of electronic preprints, known as e-prints, of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, and quantitative finance, which can be accessed online. In many fields of mathematics and physics, almost all scientific papers are self-archived on the arXiv. Begun on August 14, 1991, arXiv.org passed the half-million article milestone on October 3, 2008, and hit a million by the end of 2014. By 2014 the submission rate had grown to more than 8,000 per month."--WiKi

For my first paper, it is a good news that I can write it up to 16 pages with help of my supervisor and my friend. However, most academic conferences only allow at most 12 pages, and some even just allow 9 pages... One solution is to upload my full paper to some site, then cite the full paper in my conference paper. At beginning, I just put the full paper on my homepage in my department. But it is not good. Because, I just can maintain my homepage before I graduate. Then, I get a suggestion from my supervisor, "You should try arXiv!"

Woo~ arXiv is born for the guys like me. I really like this site. But the uploading process is quite hard. It just accept latex files, as latex files are easier to study for some research areas, like natural language processing. Okay~ It takes me a really hard time to upload my paper successfully. To make a note, I write several key points here.

* remove all the % in latex file, which means no comments allowed
* use pdf instead of eps when insert figures (I am not sure jpg, tif or some other format)
* just upload tex, bbl, cls and included figures
* no hierarchical folders
* zip the whole files, then upload the zip file

Hope my tips can help you. Good Luck~ :)
