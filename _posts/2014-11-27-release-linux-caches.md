(This article is written by a guru [slm](http://unix.stackexchange.com/users/7453/slm) on [StackExchange](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/87908/how-do-you-empty-the-buffers-and-cache-on-a-linux-system).)


If you ever want to empty it you can use this chain of commands.

	$ free && sync && echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches && free

             	total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
	Mem:       1018916     980832      38084          0      46924     355764
	-/+ buffers/cache:     578144     440772
	Swap:      2064376        128    2064248
             	total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
	Mem:       1018916     685008     333908          0        224     108252
	-/+ buffers/cache:     576532     442384
	Swap:      2064376        128    2064248
You can signal the Linux Kernel to drop various aspects of cached items by changing the numeric argument to the above command.

NOTE: clean up memory of unnecessary things (Kernerl 2.6.16 or newer). Always make sure to run sync first to flush useful things out to disk!!!

To free pagecache:

	$ echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
	
To free dentries and inodes:

	$ echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
	
To free pagecache, dentries and inodes:

	$ echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
	
The above are meant to be run as root. If you're trying to do them using `sudo` then you'll need to change the syntax slightly to something like these:

	$ sudo sh -c 'echo 1 >/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'
	$ sudo sh -c 'echo 2 >/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'
	$ sudo sh -c 'echo 3 >/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'
	
**NOTE:** There's a more esoteric version of the above command if you're into that:

	$ echo "echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches" | sudo sh
	
Why the change in syntax? The `/bin/echo` program is running as root, because of `sudo`, but the shell that's redirecting echo's output to the root-only file is still running as you. Your current shell does the redirection before `sudo` starts.

**Seeing what's in the buffers and cache**
Take a look at `linux-ftools` if you'd like to analyze the contents of the buffers & cache. Specifically if you'd like to see what files are currently being cached.

**fincore**
With this tool you can see what files are being cached within a give directory.

	fincore [options] files...

  		--pages=false      Do not print pages
  		--summarize        When comparing multiple files, print a summary report
 	    --only-cached      Only print stats for files that are actually in cache.
 	 
For example, `/var/lib/mysql/blogindex`:

	root@xxxxxx:/var/lib/mysql/blogindex# fincore --pages=false --summarize --only-cached *

	total cached size: 32847278080
	
With the above output you can see that there are several *.MYD, *.MYI, and *.frm files that are currently being cached.

**Swap**
If you want to clear out your swap you can use the following commands.

	$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
	Mem:       7987492    7298164     689328          0      30416     457936
	-/+ buffers/cache:    6809812    1177680
	Swap:      5963772     609452    5354320
	
Then use this command to disable swap:

	$ swapoff -a
	
You can confirm that it's now empty:

	$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
	Mem:       7987492    7777912     209580          0      39332     489864
	-/+ buffers/cache:    7248716     738776
	Swap:            0          0          0
	
And to re-enable it:

	$ swapon -a
	
And now reconfirm with `free`:

	$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
	Mem:       7987492    7785572     201920          0      41556     491508
	-/+ buffers/cache:    7252508     734984
	Swap:      5963772          0    5963772
	
	
	
	
	
	
I really like this article. One easy command is `free && sync && echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches && free`. Enjoy it by yourself.
